Let's walk through the steps to enable Flatpak support on your Chromebook without using Linux. Although the tutorial I provided earlier was for Ubuntu, I'll adapt the instructions for ChromeOS:
- Check System Requirements:
    - Ensure you have an x86-based Chromebook running ChromeOS 80 or later.
    - Verify this by opening the Chrome browser and typing chrome://version in the address bar. If needed, follow Google's instructions to upgrade your OS.
- Enable Linux Support:
    - Go to your system settings and click on the Linux icon to enable Linux apps on your Chromebook.
    - Open the Terminal and check if you have the correct Linux version by running:
___________________
cat /etc/os-release
___________________
If the version is not 10 (buster) or above, run the update script:
___________________________________________________________
sudo bash /opt/google/cros-containers/bin/upgrade_container
___________________________________________________________
This script may take some time depending on your Chromebook's speed and internet connection.
    - Restart your Linux container by either right-clicking the Terminal icon and selecting Shut down Linux (Beta) or simply restarting your Chromebook.
- Enable Flatpak:
    - Flatpak is a universal packaging format for Linux. To enable it, follow these steps:
        - Open the Terminal and run:
____________________________
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flatpak
____________________________

        - Add the Flathub repository:
_______________________________________________________________________________________
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
_______________________________________________________________________________________
        - Restart your system or log out and log back in.
- Install Firefox:
    - Once Flatpak is set up, install Firefox from the Terminal:
_____________________________________________
flatpak install flathub org.mozilla.firefox
_____________________________________________
Now you're all set! You can enjoy browsing with Firefox on your Chromebook without needing Linux. ü¶äüåê
